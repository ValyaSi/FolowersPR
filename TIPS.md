## Zoom into a zone

Double click on empty zone without shape don't work, to zoom on a portion of the graph, we need to create a zone.  
  
Example :  

1. Replace source by value of this [model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algenty/flowcharting-repository/master/graphs/ch2_zone.drawio)
2. Open graph in with button "Edit Draw".
3. Create a zone with a rectangle.
4. Resize the zone with the aim that all "A" are in rectangle.
5. Put it to back.
6. In style panel, uncheck "fill" and "line" or keep it visible.
7. Duplicate rectangle : Select rectangle, hold Ctrl and move rectangle on "C".
8. Resize and repeat for the "B".

## Floorplan colorization

In draw.io, use a rectangle to front on the room and reduce opacity to see under the rectangle when color changes.
Uncheck the line if you don't want to see the borderlines.
