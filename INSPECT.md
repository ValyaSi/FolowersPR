### Rename an Id
The ids in draw.io are generated with a unique number or a string . You cannot rename directly in draw.io, or only in xml but it's boring and dangerous.  
In Inspect panel, it's possible to rename it by double click on Id, Validate changes with button 'Apply change' or 'Reinit' to cancel.
Be carreful, Id must be unique.

### Match
If a symbol is present in the line, thats mean object is defined in a rule and it matching.

## Panel data
