# Color/Tooltip Mappings
In this section, choose the shapes and conditions of use.

## Identify by
You can select the method of selection for the field "What" :    
    - by the uniq ID of shapes.
    - by the value of the text (experimental).

## Regular exression
If checked, the field "What" accepts a regular expression (less efficient) like this :
```
/.*My label.*/
```

### Buttons

  - ![hide](images/fa-hide.png) : Hide/ignore line from current rule
  - ![link](images/fa-link.png) : Click on it to select shapes/object in panel and auto fill input with id object.

### What
Enter the id or text of shape, if the field "regular expression" is checked, regular expression is accepted but less efficient for performance.  
You can target/select the shape by clicking on link button.
